Hello! My name is Xingchen SHA and I also go by Patrick. I am a senior at Columbia University, enrolled in the joint bachelor's degree program between Columbia University and City University of Hong Kong. I spent the first two years of my undergraduate studies in Hong Kong, followed by a nine-month research assistant internship in Hong Kong. Afterward, I continued my studies at Columbia University in New York. I am expected to graduate in May 2025 with two bachelor’s degrees, one from each institution. 

In 2021, I undertook a research internship at the [Video, Image, and Sound Analysis Lab (VISAL)](http://visal.cs.cityu.edu.hk/), where I worked on designing new deep learning frameworks and benchmarks for image captioning, guided by [Antoni B. Chan](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~abchan/).
In 2022, I served as a full-time research assistant at Hong Kong Chu Hai College, while taking classes on weekends. I collaborated on facility location games under the guidance of [Hau Chan](https://cse.unl.edu/~hchan/) and [Minming Li](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~minmli/).
During my time at CityU, I also had the privilege of working with [Pinyan Lu](http://pinyanlu.com/) on mechanism design problems with private preferences.

In 2023, I transitioned to Columbia University and began working closely with [Haris Aziz](https://sites.google.com/site/harisaziz/), [Toby Walsh](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~tw/), and [Lirong Xia](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~lirong.xia/), focusing on fairness and efficiency in decision-making processes. I am also a member of the project [Fair Sequential Collective Decision Making](https://sites.google.com/view/fair-decisions).

In the summer of 2024, I visited the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, hosted by Hau Chan, to work on Schelling Games.

In the fall of 2024, I visited the University of Southern California, hosted by [Evi Micha](https://evi-micha.github.io/), where I researched proportional fairness in hierarchical clustering.

Currently, I am collaborating with [Chengzhi Mao](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcz/) and [Junfeng Yang](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/) at Columbia on jailbreaking and hallucination issues in large language models.

I am also part of the Decentralized Finance and Game Theory Seminar with [Jason Milionis](https://jasonmili.github.io/), where I study blockchain technologies, auction-based lending protocols, liquidations, and Sybil-resistant governance mechanisms.
My current research interests include, but are not limited to, algorithmic game theory, reinforcement learning, and AI for social good. I am proactive and open to exploring new topics, always eager to engage with emerging research areas.
