Hello! My name is Xingchen SHA and I also go by Patrick. I am a senior at Columbia University, enrolled in the joint bachelor's degree program between Columbia University and City University of Hong Kong. I spent the first two years of my undergraduate studies in Hong Kong, followed by a nine-month research assistant internship in Hong Kong. Afterward, I continued my studies at Columbia University in New York. I am expected to graduate in May 2025 with two bachelor’s degrees, one from each institution. 

During my time at CityU, I had the privilege of working with 
[Hau Chan](https://cse.unl.edu/~hchan/), [Vincent Chau](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2021/0318/c23024a364637/page.htm), [Ken C. K. Fong](https://scholars.ln.edu.hk/en/persons/chi-kit-ken-fong), [Minming Li](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~minmli/),[Pinyan Lu](http://pinyanlu.com/) and [Jialin Zhang](http://english.ict.cas.cn/people/scien/bln/202303/t20230315_328233.html).

<!-- In 2021, I undertook a research internship at the [Video, Image, and Sound Analysis Lab (VISAL)](http://visal.cs.cityu.edu.hk/), where I worked on designing new deep learning frameworks and benchmarks for image captioning, guided by [Antoni B. Chan](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~abchan/).
In 2022, I served as a full-time research assistant at Hong Kong Chu Hai College, while taking classes on weekends. I collaborated on facility location games under the guidance of [Hau Chan](https://cse.unl.edu/~hchan/), [Vincent Chau](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/2021/0318/c23024a364637/page.htm), [Ken C. K. Fong](https://scholars.ln.edu.hk/en/persons/chi-kit-ken-fong) and [Minming Li](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~minmli/).
During my time at CityU, I also had the privilege of working with [Pinyan Lu](http://pinyanlu.com/) and [Jialin Zhang](http://english.ict.cas.cn/people/scien/bln/202303/t20230315_328233.html) on mechanism design problems with private preferences.-->

Both within and beyond research, I am passionate about inclusive teaching and volunteering. I served as the student helper and provided IT services for the Hong Kong Secondary School Coding Challenge ([HKSC](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~hksc/)) for two years, organizing annual programming contests for talented high school students in Hong Kong. 

I was also fortunate to receive the HKSAR Government Scholarship, the CityU Scholarship, and the College of Engineering Dean’s Scholarship during my undergraduate study in Hong Kong.

In 2023, I transitioned to Columbia University and began working closely with [Haris Aziz](https://sites.google.com/site/harisaziz/), [Toby Walsh](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~tw/), and [Lirong Xia](https://people.cs.rutgers.edu/~lirong.xia/), focusing on fairness and efficiency in decision-making processes. I am also a member of the project [Fair Sequential Collective Decision Making](https://sites.google.com/view/fair-decisions) funded by the United States National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

<!--In the summer of 2024, I visited the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, hosted by Hau Chan.

In the fall of 2024, I visited the University of Southern California for one week, hosted by [Evi Micha](https://evi-micha.github.io/).-->

<!--I also worked with [Junfeng Yang](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~junfeng/) at Columbia on jailbreaking and hallucination issues in large language models.-->

<!--I am also part of the Decentralized Finance and Game Theory Seminar hosted by [Jason Milionis](https://jasonmili.github.io/), where I studied blockchain technologies, auction-based lending protocols, liquidations, and Sybil-resistant governance mechanisms. -->

My current research interests include, but are not limited to, algorithmic game theory, large language models, and automatic mechanims design. I am proactive and open to exploring new topics, always eager to engage with emerging research areas.

<!--During my undergraduate journey, I have had the privilege of working under the guidance of several esteemed professors: [Antoni B. Chan](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~abchan/), , , , , ,  [list in chronological order].
