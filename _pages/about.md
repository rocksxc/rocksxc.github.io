-Hello! My name is Xingchen SHA and I also go by Patrick. I am a senior student in the joint bachelor's degree program between Columbia University and City University of Hong Kong. I spent the first two years of my undergraduate studies in Hong Kong, followed by a nine-month research assistant internship in Hong Kong. Afterward, I continued my studies at Columbia University in New York. My research interests include, but are not limited to, algorithmic game theory, reinforcement learning, and AI for social good. During my undergraduate journey, I have had the privilege of working under the guidance of several esteemed professors: [Hau Chan](https://cse.unl.edu/~hchan/), Minming Li, Vincent Chau, Ken Fong, Wei-Lun Lo, Pinyan Lu, Jialin Zhang, Haris Aziz, Toby Walsh, Lirong Xia, Chengzhi Mao, Junfeng Yang [list in chronological order].
